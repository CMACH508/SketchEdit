# SketchEdit: Editing Freehand Sketches at the Stroke-level
This is the official implementation of the paper "SketchEdit: Editing Freehand Sketches at the Stroke-level", which was accepted for IJCAI-2024.
You can edit freehand sketches by picking any strokes and modifying them to generate creative sketches without having to think about determining the position of the strokes.

# Installation
```
git clone https://github.com/CMACH508/SketchEdit/
cd SketchEdit
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
# Preparing Dataset
Download data from the [QuickDraw dataset](https://quickdraw.withgoogle.com/data) for the corresponding categories and storage these data in the './dataset/' fold.

# Training
```
# The pretrained model of 17-category are provided in the './model_save/' fold. You can train your own dataset as follows.
# Encoder and Decoder. We recommend using more categories.
python -u Train.py
# Noise predicetor U-Net.
python -u Diffusion_Train.py
```

# Evaluation
```
# Visualize the groudtruth sketches to './GroundTruth/' fold.
python -u DrawAll.py
# Reconstruct sketches with original stroke locations.
python -u Inference.py
# Reconstruct sketches with generated stroke locations.
python -u Diffusion_Inference.py


# Calculate metrics.
cd evaluations

# Inference
```
# Record the strokes and their embeddings to './stroke/' fold.
python -u Dataset.py
python -u save_embedding.py

# Replace strokes, inteplorate between strokes, and add strokes.
# First, select the to be edited sketch and referenced sketch from the './GroundTruth/' fold and record their id, e.g. 7886 (the 386th sketches in the test set of 'angel') and 8196.
# Second, according to the shape of strokes, select the corresponding id of to be edited strokes and referenced strokes from the './stroke/' fold.
# Third, record the selected strokes' id, e.g. the 3rd stroke of 7886 and the 4th stroke of 8196. If you want to add a stroke, trying to select the first padding stroke as to be edited stroke, e.g. 5th stroke of 7886.
# Finally, modify the parameters in "Replace.py" and run the code. You will find the creative sketches in './sample_tmp/' fold.

python -u Replace.py

The parameters in "Replace.py" are followings:
    sketch_idx = 7886  # to be edited sketch
    sketch_stroke_idx = [3] # to be edited strokes
    template_idx =8196 # referenced sketch
    template_stroke_idx = [4] # referenced strokes from referenced sketch
```
